# Bits And Pictures

You have a gazillion cool photo's, your friends have even more.. and they're all somewhere on some USB disk waiting to get sorted.... one day.

Bits And Pictures* is an Open Source management system for you own media.
It's main focus is on providing a data model + API to allow systems to build awesome photo tools.

(*) didn't want to waist more minutes figuring out a working title

## Open
Pictures are private, so you want to be in charge of it:

* Storage: you decide! USB disk, NAS, cloud..
* Database: you own it
* Code: you use, write or edit it

## Project
This project is just getting started; there's not even code yet :)
Currently working on the [content model](http://pointnorth.io/#content-modeling) in the /docs folder.

## Feedback
Interested? Love to hear your feedback, work together, have a coffee :)
