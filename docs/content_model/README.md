# Content Models
This folder contains the content models for this application.
The content models follow [pointnorth's](http://pointnorth.io/#content-modeling) approach.


##  Models
Currently the following models have a basic implementation:

* [Album](./album.md) - Album of photos
* [Photo](./photo.md) - Photo and meta information (exif)
* [File](./file.md) - The actual file
* [Person](./person.md) - Person to appear on a photo
* [Term](./term.md) - Tag used for photos / albums
* [User](./user.md) - Users of the system
